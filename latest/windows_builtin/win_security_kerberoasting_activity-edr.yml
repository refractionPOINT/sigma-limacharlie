    description: 'This rule will collect the data needed to start looking into possible
      kerberoasting activity.

      Further analysis or computation within the query is needed focusing on requests
      from one specific host/IP towards multiple service names within a time period
      of 5 seconds.

      You can then set a threshold for the number of requests and time between the
      requests to turn this into an alert.
