    description: 'Detects execution of the "mofcomp" utility as a child of a suspicious
      shell or script running utility or by having a suspicious path in the commandline.

      The "mofcomp" utility parses a file containing MOF statements and adds the classes
      and class instances defined in the file to the WMI repository.

      Attackers abuse this utility to install malicious MOF scripts
