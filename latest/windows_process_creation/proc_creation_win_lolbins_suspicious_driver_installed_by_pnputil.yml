    falsepositives:
    - Pnputil.exe being used may be performed by a system administrator.
    - Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
      changes in your environment.
    - Pnputil.exe being executed from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If
      known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
