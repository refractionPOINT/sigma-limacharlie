    description: Detects Possible usage of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) binary
      as a LOLBIN to execute arbitrary linux and windows commands
    falsepositives:
    - Automation and orchestration scripts may use this method to execute scripts
      etc.
    - Legitimate use by Windows to kill processes opened via WSL (example VsCode WSL
      server)
