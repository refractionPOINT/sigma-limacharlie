    description: 'Detects the execution of WMIC in order to get a list of firewall,
      antivirus and antispywware products.

      Adversaries often enumerate security products installed on a system to identify
      security controls and potential ways to evade detection or disable protection
      mechanisms.

      This information helps them plan their next attack steps and choose appropriate
      techniques to bypass security measures.

      '
    falsepositives:
    - Legitimate use of wmic.exe for reconnaissance of firewall, antivirus and antispywware
      products.
