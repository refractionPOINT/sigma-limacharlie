    description: 'Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in
      large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and
      network resources.

      Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques
      through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives
