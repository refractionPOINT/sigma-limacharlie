    description: 'Detects a suspicious copy operation that tries to copy a program
      from system (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) directories to another on disk.

      Often used to move LOLBINs such as ''certutil'' or ''desktopimgdownldr'' to
      a different location with a different name in order to bypass detections based
      on locations.

    - Depend on scripts and administrative tools used in the monitored environment
      (For example an admin scripts like https://www.itexperience.net/sccm-batch-files-and-32-bits-processes-on-64-bits-os/)
    - When cmd.exe and xcopy.exe are called directly
    - When the command contains the keywords but not in the correct order
