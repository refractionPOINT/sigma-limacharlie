    description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
      a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process.
      This way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the
      procdump executable.
    falsepositives:
    - Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
    - Another tool that uses the command line switches of Procdump
