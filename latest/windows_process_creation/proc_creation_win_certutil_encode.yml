    description: Detects the execution of certutil with the "encode" flag to encode
      a file to base64. This can be abused by threat actors and attackers for data
      exfiltration
    falsepositives:
    - As this is a general purpose rule, legitimate usage of the encode functionality
      will trigger some false positives. Apply additional filters accordingly
