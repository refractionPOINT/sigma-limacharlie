    description: 'This rule detects execution of a PowerShell code through the sqlps.exe
      utility, which is included in the standard set of utilities supplied with the
      MSSQL Server.

      Script blocks are not logged in this case, so this utility helps to bypass protection
      mechanisms based on the analysis of these logs.

    falsepositives:
    - Direct PS command execution through SQLPS.exe is uncommon, childprocess sqlps.exe
      spawned by sqlagent.exe is a legitimate action.
