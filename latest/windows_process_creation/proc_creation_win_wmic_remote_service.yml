    description: 'An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service
      is running on a remote device.

      When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen
      if it exists.

      A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service
      queried is not running.

      A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default) ERROR Description
      =The RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreacheable
