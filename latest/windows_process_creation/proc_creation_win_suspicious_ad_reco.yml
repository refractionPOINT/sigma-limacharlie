    description: 'Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission
      settings.

      The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine
      which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.

      Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated
      permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.
