    description: 'An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access
      software, such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish
      an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.

      These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and
      may be allowed by application control within a target environment.

      Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when
      compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation:
