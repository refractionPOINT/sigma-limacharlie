    description: Detects execution of "odbcconf" with "INSTALLDRIVER" which installs
      a new ODBC driver. Attackers abuse this to install and run malicious DLLs.
    falsepositives:
    - Legitimate driver DLLs being registered via "odbcconf" will generate false positives.
      Investigate the path of the DLL and its contents to determine if the action
      is authorized.
