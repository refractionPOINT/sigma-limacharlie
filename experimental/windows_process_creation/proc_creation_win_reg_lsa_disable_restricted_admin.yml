    description: 'Detect activation of DisableRestrictedAdmin to disable RestrictedAdmin
      mode.

      RestrictedAdmin mode prevents the transmission of reusable credentials to the
      remote system to which you connect using Remote Desktop.

      This prevents your credentials from being harvested during the initial connection
      process if the remote server has been compromise
