    description: 'Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by
      using a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process.

      This way we are also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the
      procdump executable.

      '
    falsepositives:
    - Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
    - Another tool that uses command line flags similar to ProcDump
