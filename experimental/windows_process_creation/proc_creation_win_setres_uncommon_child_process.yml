    description: 'Detects uncommon child process of Setres.EXE.

      Setres.EXE is a Windows server only process and tool that can be used to set
      the screen resolution.

      It can potentially be abused in order to launch any arbitrary file with a name
      containing the word "choice" from the current execution path.
