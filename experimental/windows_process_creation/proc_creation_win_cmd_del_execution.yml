    description: 'Detects execution of the builtin "del"/"erase" commands in order
      to delete files.

      Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.

      Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by
      an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network
      and how.

      Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion
      process to minimize the adversary''s footprint.
