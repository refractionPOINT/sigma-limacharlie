    description: 'Detects the execution of the MSXSL utility. This can be used to
      execute Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files. These files are commonly
      used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files.

      Adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially
      bypassing application whitelisting defenses.
