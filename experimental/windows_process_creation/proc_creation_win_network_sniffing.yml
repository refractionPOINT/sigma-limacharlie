    description: 'Detects potential network sniffing via use of network tools such
      as "tshark", "windump" or "netsh".

      Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor
      or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.

      An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively
      access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger
      amount of data.
