    description: Detects when a user performs data exfiltration by using DataSvcUtil.exe
    falsepositives:
    - DataSvcUtil.exe being used may be performed by a system administrator.
    - Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
      changes in your environment.
    - DataSvcUtil.exe being executed from unfamiliar users should be investigated.
      If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
