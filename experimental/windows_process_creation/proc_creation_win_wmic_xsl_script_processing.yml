    description: 'Detects the execution of WMIC with the "format" flag to potentially
      load XSL files.

      Adversaries abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially
      bypassing application whitelisting defenses.

      Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the
      processing and rendering of data within XML files.
