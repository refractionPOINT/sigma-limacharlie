    description: 'Threat actors can use an older version of the auditpol binary available
      inside the NT resource kit to change audit policy configuration to impair detection

      as well as restoring a custom policy owned by the threat actor.

      as it was replaced by a newer version. The FP rate should be very low except
      for tools that use a similar flag structure
