    description: 'HxTsr.exe is a Microsoft compressed executable file called Microsoft
      Outlook Communications.

      HxTsr.exe is part of Outlook apps, because it resides in a hidden "WindowsApps"
      subfolder of "C:\Program Files".

      Any instances of hxtsr.exe not in this folder may be malware camouflaging itself
      as HxTsr.exe
