    description: 'Detects a suspicious local successful logon event where the Logon
      Package is Kerberos, the remote address is set to localhost, and the target
      user SID is the built-in local Administrator account.

      This may indicate an attempt to leverage a Kerberos relay attack variant that
      can be used to elevate privilege locally from a domain joined limited user to
      local System privileges.
