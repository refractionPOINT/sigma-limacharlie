    description: 'Detects "read access" requests on the services registry key.

      Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry
      entries used by services.

      Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services
      to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control,
      in order to launch their own code when a service starts.
