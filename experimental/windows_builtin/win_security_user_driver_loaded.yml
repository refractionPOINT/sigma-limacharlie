    description: 'Detects the usage of the ''SeLoadDriverPrivilege'' privilege. This
      privilege is required to load or unload a device driver.

      With this privilege, the user can dynamically load and unload device drivers
      or other code in to kernel mode.

      This user right does not apply to Plug and Play device drivers.

      If you exclude privileged users/admins and processes, which are allowed to do
      so, you are maybe left with bad programs trying to load malicious kernel drivers.

      This will detect Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs)
      and the usage of Sysinternals and various other tools. So you have to work with
      a whitelist to find the bad stuff.

      '
    falsepositives:
    - Other legimate tools loading drivers. Including but not limited to, Sysinternals,
      CPU-Z, AVs etc. A baseline needs to be created according to the used products
      and allowed tools. A good thing to do is to try and exclude users who are allowed
      to load drivers.
