    description: Detects a suspicious download using the BITS client from a FQDN that
      is unusual. Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute or clean
      up after malicious payloads.
    falsepositives:
    - This rule doesn't exclude other known TLDs such as ".org" or ".net". It's recommended
