    description: Detects DNS queries to a TeamViewer domain only resolved by a TeamViewer
      client by an image that isn't named TeamViewer (sometimes used by threat actors
      for obfuscation)
    falsepositives:
    - Unknown binary names of TeamViewer
    - Depending on the environment the rule might require some initial tuning before
      usage to avoid FP with third party applications
